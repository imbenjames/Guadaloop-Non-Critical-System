Release AutoBot v2.4


Done:


- Change code for smaller power resistor on power sensor
- Auto start up


To Do:

- State machine logic

- Battery % checker (integrate power consumption and log it)
- Pod health with min max next to it
- Communications heartbeat on HQ
- Integrate accelerometer data into pod code & HQ main
- Read distance, velocity, and acceleration from lasers
- Logic to always count with wheel lasers
- Packaging UDP data
- Countdown clock to braking, adjustable during run. Start after 2 tape counts
- HQ UI for competition

- Calibration for ToFs
- Detect emag engagement through dip in current
- Stream data to HQ




Help:

- Syncing timestamp to myRIO from HQ

- Set up new router

- Wire everything in

- Stopping all the loops

- UDP communications

- Lasers
  
- Moving down to FPGA

- What is our team ID?



NOT doing:

- Live video stream with USB endoscope cam


- Replay Run UI




- Write Data to jumpdrive
- Logging
